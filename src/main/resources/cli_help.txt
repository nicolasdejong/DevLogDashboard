Possible JVM options:
-Dserver.port=<port>  Server port (default is 8099 or from services.yaml, 0 for random)
-Droot=<dir>          Where to load jars from (default is current directory)
-DpropFile=<file>     yaml file (default is services.yaml in local dir, then inner)
-Dnotray              Don't add a tray icon

Possible options:
--root[=]<dir>        Where to load jars or run commands from (default is current directory)
--server.port=<port>  Server port (default is 8099 or from services.yaml, 0 for random)
--notray              Don't add a tray icon
--noautostart         Ignore the 'start' keys of the services configuration
--startall            Act as if all services have the 'start: true' configuration
--config[=]<path>     Location where the load the configuration. When a directory path
                      is provided, 'services.yaml' will be appended.

Services configuration can be edited by extracting the services.yaml from the jar
and copying it into the directory the jar is starting from. That file takes
precedence over the internal services.yaml.
